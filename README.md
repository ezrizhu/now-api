This is the API that powers ezri.pet and other Ezri's things.

This acts as a discord bot that fetches Ezri's current discord statuses.

This also talks to the steam API to see Ezri's current steam status and what
game they're playing.

This also collects data from Ezri's workstation to be displayed on ezri.pet

Lastly, this also talks to updown.io to see if EzriCloud is up.

This code is licensed under AGPLv3, this code was not meant to be useful to
anyone else besides Ezri, so please take caution when using it.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
